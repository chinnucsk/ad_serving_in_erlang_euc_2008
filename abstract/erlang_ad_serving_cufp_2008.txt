CUFP 2008 talk proposal: Ad Serving with Erlang
By: Bob Ippolito, CTO/Founder Mochi Media, Inc.

We've been using Erlang at Mochi Media since the 2006 launch of
MochiAds, our advertising platform for Flash games. It's the first
time any of us have done any production software with a functional
programming language, and thus far it's turned out to be a great
experience. The success of the MochiAds platform led us to writing
many other products (internal and external) on the same technology
stack. We believe Erlang to be one of the key reasons why we're able
to develop more quickly and scale more easily than our competitors.

For the talk I'd like to cover:

 * Why Erlang? (distribution, concurrency, fault tolerance, ...)
 * Mochi technology stack (hardware, open source, proprietary)
 * Which parts aren't Erlang (management front-end, database, ...)
 * Functional Ad Targeting (filtering, prng, in-memory db, etc.)
 * Ad Serving Cheap Tricks (how to make it as stateless as possible)
 * Targeting/Analytics Feedback Loop
 * Lessons Learned (missteps)
 * Other Erlang products at Mochi Media

I can fit this talk into whatever time slot is available (25-45
minutes), just let me know.
